# Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Dataset

## During this project, I processed and analysed a large and diversified dataset of tweets related to COVID-19 for sentiment. 

Steps:
1. Import relevent libraries and the COVID-19 Tweets dataset.
2. Perform basic EDA to determine most relevant features and correlations.
3. Complete text preprocessing-convert text to lower case, remove special characters, emojis and punctuation.
4. Translate tweets in different languages.
5. Tokenize text to prepare for sentiment analysis.
6. Run sentiment analysis and append results to Dataframe.
7. Build text features using the 500 most common words.
8. Run Naive Bayes Classifier to predict sentiment.
